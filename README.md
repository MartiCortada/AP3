# AP3 - PROJECT
### Algorithmics  &amp; Programming 3
##### Languange: C++
This project has been developed with Jofre Poch i Soler. It consists in finding a solution to a real problem using three different models of programming (EXHAUSTIVE SEARCH, GREEDY APPROXIMATION and a METAHEURISTIC different from Basic Local Search). Finally, we decided to perform a Simulated Annealing metaheuristic algorithm.
